AI returned null move (debug mode) - skipping AI turn Main.js:1153:29

fetch('ai_system/config/AIConfig.json') .then(r => r.json()) .then(config => console.log('enable_decision:', config.modes.trace.enable_decision));

Promise { <state>: "pending" }

enable_decision: true



my config file is correctly set. the safety fallback did not fix it. Before the changes I mentioned earlier were added, everything was working correctly - so it must be from one of those files.
