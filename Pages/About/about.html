            <h2>Growing Amalgam into a Game Worth Playing</h2>
            <p>
                I first designed Amalgam over ten years ago, back in high school, inspired by Pai Sho from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>. Since then, the game has evolved dramatically—its rules have been rewritten, mechanics refined, and the design has grown far beyond its original form.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                I’ve returned to the project on and off over the years, and this release represents the most complete version yet: a fully playable game designed not just to be finished, but to support a community; one that can grow, experiment, and help shape Amalgam’s future.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                The project is fully open source [GPL-3.0 for the code & CC-BY 4.0 for the game content] to ensure Amalgam remains free, transparent, and community-driven. By releasing it this way, anyone is free to study the rules, modify mechanics, experiment with new variations, or create entirely new rulebooks. The goal isn’t a fixed, finished product, but a living game shaped by the people who play it.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                If this kind of evolving, abstract strategy game interests you, I invite you to take part. Amalgam cannot grow in isolation—but with a community behind it, it has the chance to adapt, mature, and become something truly worth playing.
            </p>
